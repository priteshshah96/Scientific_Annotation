However, this might result in a sub-optimal ToD system if it is tailored to only one ad hoc user simulator, since human users can behave differently. In this paper, we propose a framework called MUST to optimize ToD systems via leveraging Multiple User SimulaTors. The main challenges of implementing MUST fall in 1) how to adaptively determine which user simulator to interact with the ToD system at each optimization step, since the ToD system might be over-fitted to some specific user simulators, and simultaneously under-fitted to some others; 2) how to avoid catastrophic forgetting of the adaption for a simulator that is not selected for several consecutive optimization steps. To tackle these challenges, we formulate MUST as a Multi-armed bandits (MAB) problem and provide a method called MUST_adaptive that balances i) the boosting adaption for adaptive interactions between different user simulators and the ToD system and ii) the uniform adaption to avoid the catastrophic forgetting issue. With both automatic evaluations and human evaluations, our experimental results on MultiWOZ show that the dialogue system trained by MUST achieves a better performance than those trained by a single user simulator. It also has a better generalization ability when testing with unseen user simulators.",

In this study, we adopted a mixed-methods approach to exploring how interaction with avatars of similar appearance to one's own self-representation influences conversations. Such similarity was operationalized as having three levels: identicality, moderate similarity, and dissimilarity. The study found that avatars of moderate similarity have the greatest persuasiveness; however, in both identicality and moderate similarity conditions, participants felt it was easier to communicate with and lower eeriness rating to avatars than in the dissimilarity condition. Multiple linear regression further revealed that users who had relatively low self-esteem and/or were relatively conscientious were more susceptible to the positive effect of appearance similarity on persuasiveness.
