    "abstract": "Digital Humanities pedagogy seminars (DHPSs) are a common occurrence on small liberal arts campuses that are seen as acts of service within the logic of the Teaching-Research-Service model of tenure and promotion in the U.S. academy. Yet, the goal of these events is to teach faculty colleagues DH methods, inflected by DH pedagogy values, which they can then use in their undergraduate courses. As tenured and tenure-track DH specialists at small liberal arts colleges, we argue that a DHPS is pedagogical labor and should be evaluated as teaching in order to enact values-based DH more broadly. The paper provides qualitative data based on experiences at our institutions as well as quantitative data about 226 DHPSs offered in North America from July 2015 to July 2019. We focus on the impact of DHPS duration and the home institutions and roles of instructors on collaboration, experimentation, and intersectional feminism as practiced in the field.",

Digital interventions can create spaces that promote social inclusion and cohesion. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of a cultural heritage and digital storytelling application supporting a participatory approach to culture and hosting society. We evaluate our intervention in three marginalized communities with different social-cultural contexts: migrant women in Barcelona, a community living in a priority neighbourhood in Paris and second and third-generation migrants in Lisbon. Through an analysis of their application use, our findings point at their needs and desires, highlighting how the app can support social inclusion as the first step towards cohesion, but that these are heterogeneous concepts susceptible to nuanced appropriations by the different communities.",
